Flutter Fitness App is a mobile application built using Flutter, BLoC architecture, and SQLite, designed to help users take control of their health and fitness goals. The app focuses on providing a simple and effective way to plan workouts, track progress, monitor diet, and keep an eye on weight — all while working completely offline.
This project reflects my interest in mobile development, clean architecture, and building real-life, practical apps that focus on user needs and performance. It’s built with scalability and maintainability in mind, following best practices for state management and data persistence.

**What the App Does**
- **Workout Planning** – Users can create and manage their own workout plans tailored to their goals.
- **Training Progress Tracking** – After each session, users can log what they did and view their progress over time.
- **Diet Monitoring** – The app allows users to record meals and track what they eat each day.
- **Weight Tracking** – Users can enter their weight daily or weekly and visualize changes over time.
- **Offline Functionality** – Thanks to SQLite, all data is stored locally, so no internet connection is required.

**Tech Stack**
- **Flutter** – Cross-platform mobile framework
- **Dart** – Programming language
- **BLoC** – State management
- **SQLite** – Local data storage
